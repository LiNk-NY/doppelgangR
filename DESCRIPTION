Title: Identify likely duplicate samples from genomic or meta-data.
Description: The main function is doppelgangR(), which takes as minimal
   input a list of ExpressionSet object, and searches all list pairs for
   duplicated samples.  The search is based on the genomic data (exprs(eset)),
   phenotype/clinical data (pData(eset)), and "smoking guns" - supposedly unique
   identifiers found in pData(eset).
