Title: Identify likely duplicate samples from genomic or meta-data.
Description: The main function is doppelgangR(), which takes as minimal 
   input a list of ExpressionSet object, and searches all list pairs for 
   duplicated samples.  The search is based on the genomic data (exprs(eset)), 
   phenotype/clinical data (pData(eset)), and "smoking guns" - supposedly unique 
   identifiers found in pData(eset).
