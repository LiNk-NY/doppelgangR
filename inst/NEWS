Whole-genome analysis of cancer specimens is commonplace and
investigators frequently share or re-use specimens in later studies.
Duplicate expression profiles in public databases will impact
re-analysis if left undetected, a so-called “doppelgänger” effect. The
doppelgangR package uses batch correction and outlier detection among
pairwise expression profile correlations to accurately identify
duplicate profiles for cancer types where profiles are sufficiently
distinct.  It is intended for use when nucleotide-level sequence data
are unavailable, and is is effective even for specimens where
duplicated samples are profiled by different microarray technologies,
or by a combination of microarray and RNA sequencing.
